The arqive
Overview
The arqive is a web and mobile application designed to empower the LGBTQ+
community by providing a platform to share meaningful stories, events, and
information. It allows users to pin significant locations on a map, marking their
personal experiences and contributing to a collective narrative of LGBTQ+
history and community.
With a focus on creating a safe and inclusive space, The arqive enables users
to explore and share personal, historical, and community stories. It also provides
access to valuable resources such as information about safe spaces, fostering a
sense of connection and support.

Why We Use Jira?
Jira is a powerful project management tool that helps teams plan, track, and
manage software development projects effectively. It is well-suited for The arqive
project due to its features such as:
• Agile Boards: Organize and prioritize tasks using Scrum or Kanban
boards.
• Issue Tracking: Track bugs, new features, and improvements with clear
workflows.
• Collaboration Tools: Facilitate communication and progress tracking
among team members.
• Customizable Workflows: Create workflows tailored to your project
needs.
